KeyTerms may be 'Keywords' if first char is a letter (IsKeyword=true), or 'Key Symbols' otherwise. I'm not sure why, but there is a difference between 'foo' and '_foo'. KeyTerms do not get inited in the AST (NoAst=true). KeyTerms can be created on-the-fly ("?").

The "usual" whitespace rules are defaulted, override SkipWhiteSpace to change.

"x | y + z"  defaults to "x | (y + z)"... in other words it is an "or-list of plus-lists". + has higher precedece.

MakePlusRule, MakeStarRule take a NonTerminal as input and sets the rule to that input. So you don't need to explicitly set the rule as in most examples.

	MakeStarRule(thingsstar, null, (foo | joe | "bar" | alpha_char));

Never create a Make rule on the fly, as it will work but the AST builder is broken and won't visit it. Don't do this:

	constant_label.Rule = (underscore | alpha_char) + MakePlusRule(new NonTerminal("constant_label2"),label_char);

	
AST generation. Literal and Identifier node creation?
